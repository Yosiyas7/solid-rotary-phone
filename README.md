# Tic Tac Toe

## Game Instructions

### Tic Tac Toe is a *two-player* game, where each *player* takes turns to place their symbol (either **X** or **O**) on the board. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the cells on the board are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
